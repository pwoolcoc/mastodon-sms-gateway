= Mastodon SMS Bridge

This is a small application that let's a mastodon user connect their account with an SMS number, which then lets them do some
tooting over a standard SMS message

The SMS format is designed to be similar to Twitter's SMS format

You will need 1) a valid Twilio account + SMS number and 2) a valid mastodon account, to make this work
